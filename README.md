# Usage
After installing node packages with 'npm i', run the node app with 'node ./app.js' in the terminal. You should be prompted for a information about your team. Enter in the info and once you're finished follow the prompts for no more entries. This will start the render and file write process. Then, your new team will be built and awaiting your viewing inside the output folder. Simply open the html page in your browser! 

# What I learned

This project taught me a lot about outputting and directories. I actually found this project very hard and so this was good practice for these concepts. While I was already pretty comfortable with inquirer, I now learned a few more tricks such as 'when'.
